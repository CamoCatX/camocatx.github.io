Learning a new language can be hard and time-consuming but with a proper method, it can be fun and smooth. Duolingo is a very fun and effective way to learn a new language. It has many great features. One of them is streak, which is built if you complete your lessons every day. It even sends you a notification if you don't do your daily learning to remind you that in order to keep your streak, you need to do the daily learning of a few fun minutes. Also you choose your daily goal from 5 different levels: Basic, Casual, Regular, Serious, Intense, with each higher level you need to put more time energy for learning.
I'm using Duolingo to learn German and it has been a fun and effective experience so far.
