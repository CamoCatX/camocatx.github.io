### My Comment
* * *
This is a huge book about computer networking and it is absolutely necessary for a Penetration Tester or Ethical Hacker to have a good understanding of most of the topics discussed in this book, so if you are a newcomer to this field, I highly recommend this book, you may skip some parts according to your field of work, for example if you want to work in Web Application Security field, you can only read the parts that are related to your field but I absolutely recommend reading it from cover to cover. The OSI model, the IP address classes, Subnetting, Network Devices and Topologies, Routing Protocols and many other topics are necessary knowledge you must have if you want to become a successful ethical hacker.
