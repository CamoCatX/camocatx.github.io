### Amazon Description
* * *
"Imagine trying to make sense of an amalgam of Timothy Leary's eight neurological circuits, G.I. Gurdjieff's self-observation exercises, Alfred Korzybski's general semantics, Aleister Crowley's magical theorems, and the several disciplines of Yoga; not to mention Christian Science, relativity, quantum mechanics, and many other approaches to understanding the world around us. That is exactly what Robert Anton Wilson does in Prometheus Rising. In short, this is a book about how the human mind works and what you can do to make the most of yours."

### My Comment
* * *
I must admit, it is a strange book! The author tries to mix many ideas from multiple disciplines and the result is a novel but strange theory about human consciousness and how to expand it.

At the very least, this book helps to expand our models of thinking and looking at many aspects of our world and it's worth reading.
