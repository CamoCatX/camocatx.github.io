### My Comment
* * *
I had read the CEH v9 Paperback – January 1, 2017 by Sean-Philip Oriyano[^3] some years ago, This book is the new version for CEH exam. It is an easy and fast read and only recommended for newcomers, you won't get much working experience from this book but you can get yourself familiarized with almost all hacking fields so you can later choose which field you like the most so that you can focus on that one field for much more depth later. So it is a great book for newcomers.
