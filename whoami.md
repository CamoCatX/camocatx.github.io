Everytime I try to define myself, I have to make an exception to it. But if I had to give myself an idenity, something I could hold on to so I feel special, I would say I am a hacker. Not necessarily a security hacker; a cracker, but more of the old defintion. A tinker. A messer of technology. A messer of ideas. Although that would make me a philosopher...

<summary>It seems like you're a security hacker though!</summary>

Sometimes that does carry over to the real haxx0r hacking. But my intention is to learn, and how I do that is by unlocking its secrets. And no I am not a cyber-criminal. There's a difference. The difference is I won't respond to CaN i HaZ iNsTa SiR???

<summary>Who are you in real life</summary>

  I'm actually that person you think you know somewhere but you're not sure because if you go up to them, and they are actually a stranger, then that would be weird so you just causally stare instead.
