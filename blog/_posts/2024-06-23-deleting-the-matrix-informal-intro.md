## Who, what, where and why?

You might be asking those questions after reading about [the not by AI movement](https://deletethematrix.com/blog/2024/not-made-by-ai-review), or how [we are mad about being mad](https://deletethematrix.com/blog/2024/reverse-radium-craze), or even maybe, you realize that I am just trying [to get my website more seo'd](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/backlinks). Nevertheless, you might be confused, so you click over to the [whoami](https://deletethematrix.com/whoami) section, which may or may not help you, then maybe you look to other parts of the website, asking some simple questions. But suddenly this appeared and it's all solved. Lets start with the name.

## Nice name, why?

The way terms from books such as *1984* and movies such as *The Matrix* are thrown around today is almost... conspiratorial. *The Red Pill* is often sadly used to describe extreme views. I do not want to comment on any at the moment because that's later. **Why I chose this name is because**, well not just because I like the movies, but I see little details that are not covered in mainstream news sources. If you don't know what I'm talking about then read the head lines of the articles. *They are all in wonderland*. To state it clearly **this is original, investigative research that offers a counter viewpoint from the mainstream**. And no, relinquish those stereotypes. Well hey, *here's and example*. Even before this site came up, I really liked these things called weblinks. Weblinks, [as this one described](https://garlic.garden/onionring/) are like *you scratch my back I scratch yours* **except**, we both share a similar interests. These existed before good search engines, so people could find websites like each other. I would argue that [they still can't find what I want](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=48AOOynnmqU), that being people with blogs full of interesting ideas. But weblinks do this job. So after I get accepted to a weblink, I drop code such as this at the bottom of my website and then readers here can go see other sites of interest.

## Furthermore

I tend to read scientific papers, weird books and contribute to [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). I would be contributing to wikipedia even more if it had not been for the *imperious* [No Original Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research). Anyway, if have any other questions, well, here's the final backlink: <https://deletethematrix.com/contact>
