## The Urge of the Aesthetic will destroy your blue pill
This is my... personal experience of course. But recently, I read an article named [Aesthetics beat Arguments](https://copybookcourt.substack.com/p/aesthetics-beat-arguments) that reinforced this idea. It asked why, the author, a *Post-modern [right wing] Reactionary* couldn't win at convincing a communist. They couldn't successfully argue the communist's reasoning was faulty because reasoning isn't convincing. Reasoning was never part of the argument. Humanity isn't rational. Get it. The world around us is not even constructed for rationality, so why would one think that the inhabitants in it are logical!? Do I need further explanation? Ever had a young child create an infinite avalanche of whys'? You can't explain away forever, if you are being truthful, eventually you have say **"It's the thing they say we do it better that way"**. I mean, look at my own site. There's a reason I don't use Medium (besides privacy concerns). Before a single word is read, one already has assumptions. This is intentional. It's called a brand identity. It's called aesthetic. I know the logic of the written word is not enough for Red Bull. No, it has to brand itself for extreme sports and adventure. But I do confess, the top search results barely have any unique or interesting splash of color. If enough eyes see the art that I will present below, then I believe the argument for the small web, for the independent web, for the free speech web, will be won.

If you read closely to the paragraph above you will see **"If enough eyes see the art"**. IF. But this cause has powerful enemies, such as Microsoft, creator of the infamous *Internet Exploiter*. They would prefer if bing's search results would look like their offices, dull and corporate. *If you scratch my back I scratch yours*. The list is intended to be a convent overview of the creative web, but I have a feeling it won't spread with SEO. The Microsoft help article I linked above was solved by going to private browsing tab. So therefore, this list may be used to convince someone of the often more private independent web. To spread the word, either by sharing the websites on it or this whole article. Now, in no particular order, I present:
* * *
- **[Koshka's Kingdom](https://koshka.love/)** *"Informative and humorous content about topics from Autism to Ancient Egyptian religion, to astrophysics, to horror fiction, to retro computer games, in a cute and retro Web format."* This site makes me want to open the inspect tab and learn how it looks beautiful. They also have their own document on [making the web great again](https://koshka.love/mwwwga.html). This site talks mostly about personal interests that haven't been popular since the olden days of the web (like [Buff the Vampire Slayer](https://koshka.love/television/buffy.html)). The site also devotes a lot of content to [autism and neurodiversity](https://koshka.love/autism/). If you enjoy what I write and how I write on this site, you may enjoy [this](https://koshka.love/babel/normiefication),[this](https://koshka.love/babel/comedic-observations.html), and [this](https://koshka.love/babel/devils-advocate-1984.html).
- **[goblin-heart](https://goblin-heart.net/)** *"My name is October and this website is my dank little goblin space where I can hide away from the light and resume my true form as a grimy, green little monster."* At the top of the page you can pick a theme, as personal preferences on this site go beyond black and white. I personally enjoy radioactive, as it's the only one I truly can handle without [dark reader](https://darkreader.org/). Goblin Heart seems quite influential on the small web, so this short summery can't do it justice. They also have [a manifesto](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/cyberspace/internet-manifesto). Although, in contrast to [Koshka's Manifesto](https://koshka.love/mwwwga.html), it seems that toxicity and bad social relations are to blame for the decline of the web. But in Koshka's manifesto, it details that ideas like "Cyber-bullying" only started with the normalization of the web, as toxicity of irrelevant before. Goblin Heart also has some very useful resources on [individual webmastery](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/webmastery/). They don't have [many](https://goblin-heart.net/blog/060224) blog articles yet. This website lets you know what it is about very fast, the author is very upfront.
- **[Duke Nukem Is Cool](https://dukenukemis.cool/)** *"I'll kick your ass if you think this website is stupid."* As you might be able to tell, this site is themed after [Duke Nukem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem), a video game character most popular in the 2000's. The real creator is someone who goes by the name [Ashley Jones](https://dukenukemis.cool/about-me/). Since the site is littered with pictures of her, I think this is their real name. As explained [here](https://dukenukemis.cool/my-convictions/), this site is NOT intended to be a satire on a trope of 90's/00's sites, but rather a personal, *hand-coded* showcase of a very select amount of ~~obsessive compulsive disorders~~  interests. Like many on this list, the site contains out-there theories about the world around us. Like everyone else, [they have a manifesto](https://dukenukemis.cool/manifesto/). But it has a much different vibe than the others... as it it quite long and filled with many unrelated subjects, but more are connected by the idea that places and institutions of authority are securely manipulative and controlling. As the manifesto goes on, the ideas become more out there. This is not say it is necessarily false, it is just my personal observation to the flow, it's also not my job to rule your mind, you should read it for yourself.

**FOR MORE TO COME**
